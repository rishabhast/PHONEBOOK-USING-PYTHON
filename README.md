# PHONEBOOK USING PYTHON

I have implemented phone book using python, features implemented are: 

1) Adding a Contact Name and Number:
- Contact Name will be added in Title format,
- Contact Name will only be added, if it does not exit in phonebook, else "Contact already exists" validation will come,
- Contact Number will only be added if its all numeric, of 10 digit and does not exist in phonebook, else "Contact number already associated with other contact" validation will come.

2) Searching a Contact using Name or Number
- Searching Phonebook with Contact Name,
- Searching Phonebook with Contact Number.

3) Update a Contact using Name or Number
- Updating Contact using Contact Name,
- Updating Contact using Contact Number,
- Validation message "Contact not found" will come, when trying to update Contact, if it does not exists in Phonebook.

4) Deleting a Contact using Name or Number:
- Deleting Contact from Name,
- Deleting Contact from Number,
- Validation message "No Contacts in Phonebook" will come, when trying to delete Contact, if no contact exists in Phonebook,
- Validation message "No Contact exists with 'contactname' detail" will come, when trying to delete a non existing Contact.
